## Overview
This project replicates Parity Deals' core functionalities as a SaaS platform, allowing site owners to show unique discounts based on user location. Users benefit from configurable discount settings, real-time analytics, subscription management, and permission-based access. The codebase is modular, modern, and highly maintainable.
